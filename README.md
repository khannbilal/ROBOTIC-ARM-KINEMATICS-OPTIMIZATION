# Robotic Arm Kinematics Optimization

# Overview
Engineered an optimized kinematics and control framework for a 6DOF Rot3U robotic arm to achieve submillimeter precision in industrial automation tasks. The system integrates forward and inverse kinematic modeling, Jacobianbased optimization, and trajectory control to ensure high stability, precision, and repeatability under realworld operational constraints.

# Framework
Hardware: 6DOF Rot3U Robotic Arm
Software: Python, NumPy, ROS, MATLAB (validation)
Algorithms: Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) Parameterization, Jacobian Inverse Method, Gradient Descent Optimization

# Scope
 Develop a mathematical model for forward and inverse kinematics.
 Implement Jacobianbased optimization for joint angle corrections.
 Calibrate system parameters for submillimeter accuracy.
 Simulate and validate using Python and ROS before physical deployment.

# Methodology

 1. Kinematic Modeling

 Applied Denavit–Hartenberg convention to define link transformations.
 Derived homogeneous transformation matrices (A_i) for each joint.
 Computed endeffector position and orientation via matrix multiplication:
  [T = A_1 \cdot A_2 \cdot A_3 \cdot A_4 \cdot A_5 \cdot A_6]

 2. Inverse Kinematics (IK)

 Implemented numerical IK solver using Jacobian inverse and pseudoinverse.
 Added regularization term (λI) to avoid singularities.
 Optimized joint angles via gradient descent with damping for smooth motion.

 3. Optimization Loop

while error > ε:
    J = computeJacobian(q)
    Δq = α  J⁺  (x_target  f(q))
    q = q + Δq
 α: Learning rate for stability
 ε: Tolerance for position error (< 0.001 m)

 4. Control Integration

 Synchronized joint encoders and actuators via ROS.
 Implemented PID tuning for precise trajectory following.
 Validated through simulated pickandplace tasks under varying payloads.
